See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

## Theme installation

Bottom line is you want to get the files in this repo into your local development environment. There are many ways to do this, two of which we will cover here.

### via Command-line

If you're already [using Composer to manage WordPress](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/), then you might consider using composer's `create-project` command to download Sage.

The example below assumes you're using Bedrock. If you're not, simply change the target path accordingly.

```sh
composer create-project roots/sage web/app/themes/your-theme-name-here
```

Then activate the theme via [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/commands/theme/activate/).

```sh
wp theme activate your-theme-name-here
```

### via WordPress Admin Panel

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/latest) of Sage.
2. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to Appearance->Themes
3. Click Add New
4. Click Upload Theme
5. Upload the zip file that you downloaded.

## Theme setup

Edit `lib/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install gulp and Bower

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/manifest.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `http://project-name.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://project-name.dev"
  }
...
```
If your local development URL looks like `http://localhost:8888/project-name/` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:8888/project-name/"
  }
...
```

# [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roots/bedrock.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/roots/bedrock)

Bedrock is a modern WordPress stack that helps you get started with the best development tools and project structure.

Much of the philosophy behind Bedrock is inspired by the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) methodology including the [WordPress specific version](https://roots.io/twelve-factor-wordpress/).

## Features

* Better folder structure
* Dependency management with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
* Easy WordPress configuration with environment specific files
* Environment variables with [Dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)
* Autoloader for mu-plugins (use regular plugins as mu-plugins)
* Enhanced security (separated web root and secure passwords with [wp-password-bcrypt](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt))

Use [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis) for additional features:

* Easy development environments with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* Easy server provisioning with [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) (Ubuntu 14.04, PHP 5.6 or HHVM, MariaDB)
* One-command deploys

See a complete working example in the [roots-example-project.com repo](https://github.com/roots/roots-example-project.com).

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.5
* Composer - [Install](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)

## Installation

1. Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/roots/bedrock.git`
2. Run `composer install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update environment variables:
  * `DB_NAME` - Database name
  * `DB_USER` - Database user
  * `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
  * `DB_HOST` - Database host
  * `WP_ENV` - Set to environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`)
  * `WP_HOME` - Full URL to WordPress home (http://example.com)
  * `WP_SITEURL` - Full URL to WordPress including subdirectory (http://example.com/wp)
  * `AUTH_KEY`, `SECURE_AUTH_KEY`, `LOGGED_IN_KEY`, `NONCE_KEY`, `AUTH_SALT`, `SECURE_AUTH_SALT`, `LOGGED_IN_SALT`, `NONCE_SALT` - Generate with [wp-cli-dotenv-command](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-dotenv-command) or from the [WordPress Salt Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/)
4. Add theme(s) in `web/app/themes` as you would for a normal WordPress site.
5. Set your site vhost document root to `/path/to/site/web/` (`/path/to/site/current/web/` if using deploys)
6. Access WP admin at `http://example.com/wp/wp-admin`

## Deploys

There are two methods to deploy Bedrock sites out of the box:

* [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis)
* [bedrock-capistrano](https://github.com/roots/bedrock-capistrano)

Any other deployment method can be used as well with one requirement:

`composer install` must be run as part of the deploy process.
